# Project Development Notes

## Week 1 - Project Setup
- Initialized new Node.js project with TypeScript
- Set up LlamaIndex.TS with Ollama integration
- Configured local embedding model for document processing
- Created basic project structure

## Week 2 - Document Processing
- Implemented SimpleDirectoryReader for multi-format support
- Successfully parsed PDF, CSV, and text files
- Created vector embeddings using HuggingFace model
- Set up in-memory vector store for quick retrieval

## Week 3 - Agent Development
- Built agentic RAG system using workflow package
- Integrated query tool with similarity search
- Configured gemma2:latest model for local inference
- Implemented conversational interface

## Key Learnings
1. Local models provide good privacy but require more resources
2. Document chunking strategy affects retrieval quality
3. Embedding model choice impacts semantic search accuracy
4. Agent prompting is crucial for relevant responses

## Performance Notes
- Initial indexing takes ~20-30 seconds for small document set
- Query response time averages 3-5 seconds
- Memory usage stays reasonable with in-memory storage
- Ollama model loading adds ~10 seconds startup time

## Next Steps
- Add error handling for malformed documents
- Implement document metadata extraction
- Consider persistent storage for larger document sets
- Optimize chunking strategy for better retrieval
