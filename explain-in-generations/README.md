# ðŸŒŸ Explain in Generations ðŸŒŸ

It seamlessly integrates into the Chrome side panel, allowing users to switch between different generational perspectives without leaving their current page.

- Uses generation-specific cultural references and communication styles
- Real-time AI-powered text processing
